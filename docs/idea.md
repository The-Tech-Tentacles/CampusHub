## Project "The Nexus" - A Unified University Platform

### Vision

The Nexus is a unified digital ecosystem for universities and colleges, streamlining communication, collaboration, and academic progress in one place. It replaces the need to juggle multiple disconnected apps (Google Classroom, WhatsApp, Stack Overflow, LinkedIn) with a single, student‑centric platform.

### Unique Value

Holistic integration of learning management, collaboration, knowledge sharing, and portfolio building—enhanced (not replaced) by AI for mastery, matching, and resource quality.

### Key Features

The Nexus is organized into several key sections, each designed to work together smoothly.

#### 1. Home

- Dynamic Feed: Unified stream for notices, announcements, and updates.
