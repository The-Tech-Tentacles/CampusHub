## 🎯 Project Overview

CampusHub is designed as a modular university management platform with a clear progression from MVP to comprehensive solution.

### Core Principles

- **University-Focused**: Exclusively designed for educational institutions
- **Modular Architecture**: Scalable component-based system
- **User-Centric**: Three distinct portals (Student, Faculty, Admin)

5. **Basic Dashboard** - Unified interface

**Why This MVP?**

- Addresses immediate pain points in university administration
- Provides clear value proposition for early adoption
- Establishes foundation for LMS integration
- Minimal viable features with maximum impact

**Deferred to Post-MVP:**

- Full LMS (Course management, assignments, materials)
